                  PCSK9 is a protein secreted by liver cells that assumes a role in the clearance of
                  LDL-C by the regulation of LDL receptors. The typical treatment regimen is once or
                  twice-monthly injections.

                  result in additional reduction of cardiovascular risk even in patients already on
